# Kieran_Remenar_Portfolio
The code portfolio of me, Kieran Remenar

If you're here, you're either looking for my portfolio or you're in the wrong place.
If it's the former, welcome!

The Demo Game folder contains scripts from an old demo game I made for class. I also provided the zipped build of that game to play as an example of the code in action.

The zipped folder called 'AIDemo' is a project my friend Ilan Komrad and I worked on together. The zip contains a build of the game with all necessary files, as well as the scripts folder from the project. The two of us worked on the whole project, so it would be difficult to name which parts are wriiten by whom. Everything was made by us except for the Standart Asset first person controller, the robot models, and the sounds.

SpacePOM is a 3D Unity puzzle platformer I worked on with a hobbyist group which we published to Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1529800/SpacePOM/) under our company Wrong Tree Studios LLC. I found it difficult to find scripts that only I had worked on given how I joined the project fairly late, so I only provided code for the Cable Puzzle, which was made entirely by me, although I would definitely rewrite most of the script for the main puzzle systems looking back at it now.

The Godot Game is an unnanounced Godot (C#) project started by some friends and I, which is fairly close to feature-complete but currently has very little content. I have provided the scripts pertaining to three of the main systems I created mostly by myself: dialogue scripting, quests, and combat arena generation (incomplete). In this project, I worked with many systems I had never had a chance to use before, such as JSON serialization and parsing, reflection, and C# events. I also provided some sample JSONs used in each folder as well as a picture of the quest screen.
