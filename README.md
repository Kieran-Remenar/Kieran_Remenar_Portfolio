# Kieran_Remenar_Portfolio
The code portfolio of me, Kieran Remenar

If you're here, you're either looking for my portfolio or you're in the wrong place.
If it's the former, welcome!

The scripts folder is from the demo game which I have provided in a zip file. Play the demo if you want, but it's mostly there to help see the code in action.

The zipped folder called 'AIDemo' is a project my friend Ilan Komrad and I worked on together. The zip contains a build of the game with all necessary files, as well as the scripts folder from the project. The two of us worked on the whole project, so it would be difficult to name which parts are wriiten by whom. Everything was made by us except for the Standart Asset first person controller, the robot models, and the sounds.
