The code portfolio of me, Kieran Remenar

If you're here, you're either looking for my portfolio or you're in the wrong place.
If it's the former, welcome!

SpacePOM is a 3D Unity puzzle platformer I worked on with a hobbyist group which we published to Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1529800/SpacePOM/) under our company Wrong Tree Studios LLC. I found it difficult to find scripts that only I had worked on given how I joined the project fairly late, so I only provided code for the Cable Puzzle, which was made entirely by me, although I would definitely rewrite most of the script for the main puzzle systems looking back at it now.

The Godot Game is an unnanounced Godot (C#) project started by some friends and I, which is fairly close to feature-complete but currently has very little content. I have provided the scripts pertaining to three of the main systems I created mostly by myself: dialogue scripting, quests, and combat arena generation (incomplete). In this project, I worked with many systems I had never had a chance to use before, such as JSON serialization and parsing, reflection, and C# events. I also provided some sample JSONs used in each folder as well as a picture of the quest screen.
